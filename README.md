# ILPSatQubo

## Overview
ILPSatQubo is a Python project that integrates Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Quantum Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) to solve SAT problems. This repository contains the main script `ilp_sat_qubo.py`.

## Features
- **ILP Integration**: Utilizes ILP techniques to handle constraints.
- **QUBO Optimization**: Leverages QUBO for efficient problem-solving.
- **SAT Problem Solving**: Designed to address SAT (Boolean satisfiability) problems.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`

### Installation
Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/GregoryMorse/ILPSatQubo.git```
